## Welcome to Fan Layout Manager for Android by Cleveroad

Fan Layout Manager is a new library created at Cleveroad. Our ideas don’t come from nowhere, everything we invent results from the difficulties we overcome. This exactly what happened — we were fighting uniformity! Since traditional view of the simple horizontal list isn’t impressive anymore, we decided to suggest our vision adding some colours and a completely new motion path.

Cleveroad gladly shares its creation with everyone who wants to add some visual spice to their Android apps. Take Fan Layout Manager and create!

Using Fan Layout Manager you can implement the horizontal list, the items of which move like fan blades (in a circular way of a radius to your choice). To give a slightly chaotical effect to the motion, it’s possible to set an angle for the list items. So, every implementation of the library can be unique.
